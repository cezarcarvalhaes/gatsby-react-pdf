# Gatsby React PDF Example Repo

Dev environment works fine. PDFs display without issue.

Builds fail with error:

```
Generating SSR bundle failed

Can't resolve 'canvas' in '/Users/cezar/Documents/Buddy/Repos/gatsby-react-pdf/node_modules/pdfjs-dist/legacy/build'

If you're trying to use a package make sure that 'canvas' is installed. If you're trying to use a local file make sure that the path
 is correct.

File: node_modules/pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.js:12360:21
